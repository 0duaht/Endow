Endow
=====

On various platforms, we are able to exchange messages with friends, relatives, colleagues, and other acquaintances. However, on over 90% of these platforms, messages are restricted to text or images. However, with Endow, this restriction could be circumvented. Videos, sounds, archives and any other type of file could be 'hidden' behind images with Endow. The app provides two switches. A switch to endow images with additional content/files, and a switch to extract these contents from endowed images.
